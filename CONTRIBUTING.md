## Code of Conduct

This project and everyone participating in it is governed by the [Bytetools Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md). By participating, you are expected to uphold this code. Please report unacceptable behavior to [lwshakib](https://github.com/lwshakib).

## I Have a Question

> If you want to ask a question, we assume that you have read the available [Documentation](README.md).

Before you ask a question, it is best to search for existing [Issues](https://github.com/lwshakib/bytetools/issues) that might help you. In case you have found a suitable issue and still need clarification, you can write your question in this issue. It is also advisable to search the internet for answers first.

If you then still feel the need to ask a question and need clarification, we recommend the following:

- Open an [Issue](https://github.com/lwshakib/bytetools/issues/new).
- Provide as much context as you can about what you're running into.
- Provide project and platform versions (nodejs, npm, etc), depending on what seems relevant.

## I Want To Contribute

### Reporting Bugs

An effective bug report helps us fix issues faster.

- **Use a clear and descriptive title** for the issue to identify the problem.
- **Describe the steps to reproduce the exact steps** which reproduce the problem in as many details as possible.
- **Provide specific examples** to demonstrate the steps. Include links to files or GitHub projects, or copy/pasteable snippets, which you use in those examples.
- **Describe the behavior you observed after following the steps** and point out what exactly is the problem with that behavior.
- **Explain which behavior you expected to see instead and why.**
- **Include screenshots and animated GIFs** which show you following the described steps and clearly demonstrate the problem. 

### Suggesting Enhancements

- **Use a clear and descriptive title** for the issue to identify the suggestion.
- **Provide a step-by-step description of the suggested enhancement** in as many details as possible.
- **Provide specific examples** to demonstrate the steps.
- **Describe the current behavior** and **explain which behavior you expected to see instead** and why.

### Your First Code Contribution

Unsure where to begin contributing to Bytetools? You can start by looking through these `good-first-issue` and `help-wanted` issues:

- [Good first issues](https://github.com/lwshakib/bytetools/labels/good%20first%20issue) - issues which should only require a few lines of code, and a test or two.
- [Help wanted issues](https://github.com/lwshakib/bytetools/labels/help%20wanted) - issues which should be a bit more involved than `good first issue`s.

### Pull Requests

The process described here has several goals:

- Maintain Bytetools's quality
- Fix problems that are important to users
- Engage the community in working toward the best possible tools
- Enable a sustainable system for Bytetools's maintainers to review contributions

Please follow these steps to have your contribution considered by the maintainers:

1. Follow all instructions in [the template](.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md) (if available).
2. Follow the [styleguides](#styleguides).
3. After you submit your pull request, verify that all status checks are passing.
